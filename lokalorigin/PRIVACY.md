- Personal identification information
- Email addresses
- Names or contact information
- Location data
- Usage analytics or tracking data

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The following information is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers:

- **Subscription Status**: Whether you have an active premium subscription (managed by Apple)

### Third-Party Data Sources

## Camera and Photo Library Access

### Camera
LokalChoice requires camera access to scan barcodes. Camera access is:

- Never used to capture, store, or transmit photos without your explicit action
- Controlled by iOS system permissions that you can revoke at any time

### Photo Library
If you choose to upload a photo to scan a barcode:
- You select specific photos through the iOS photo picker
- Only the selected photo is processed locally on your device
- We do not access, store, or transmit your photo library contents
- Photo uploads are entirely optional

## How We Use Information

Information stored locally on your device is used solely to:
- Display your scan history
- Remember your preferences and settings
- Provide a personalized experience
- Enable you to revisit previously scanned products

## Data Storage and Security

- All app data is stored locally on your device using iOS secure storage
- No data is transmitted to external servers (except barcode lookups to OpenFoodFacts)
- Your data remains on your device and is protected by iOS security features
- If you delete the app, all locally stored data is permanently removed

## In-App Purchases

Premium subscriptions are processed through Apple's App Store:
- Apple manages all payment information

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any user information because we do not collect personal data. The only data transmission is:

## Data Retention

- Local data persists until you delete it or uninstall the app
- No data is retained on external servers
